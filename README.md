# Zero-Knowledge-Proofs
The repository contents the impelementation of the several Zero-Knowledge-Proofs, each proof was implemented in triptic, meaning each of the zkp class have provided version for: 
* interactive -> Bob sending the challenge to Alice, that Alice must include in calculating the response to Bob. 
* non-interactive -> Bob validates only the response provided by Alice and public keys. 
* non-interactive + Elliptic curve -> the same as above plus providing extra security with ECCs.
